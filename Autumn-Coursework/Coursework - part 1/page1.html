        <h1 class="headings-page1">Youth</h1> <br>
        <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London, England on June 8, 1955. <br>
          He was born to parents Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, and was the eldest of three siblings. <br> <br>
          The Berners-Lee couple worked on the very first ever commercial computer, known as the Ferranti Mark 1, after the government contracted Ferranti to build a commericial computer for the masses <br>
          This shows the clear connection that Timothy had to computers and technology at a young age. <br> <br>
          He attended Sheen Mount Primary school, then went on to spend four years at Emanuel School in south west London. <br>
          As a child, he was a very keen train-spotter and learned all about electronics through tinkering around with different electronic railway systems found in the home <br> <br>
          After his school years, Berners-Lee enrolled at the University of Oxford, at Queen's College for three years and received a first class degree in physics in 1976. <br> <br> <br>

        <h1 class="headings-page1">Employment</h1> <br>
        <p>After graduating, Tim Berners-Lee was appointed as an engineer for Plessey Telecom, which is located in Poole, Dorset where he worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. <br> <br>
          In the late-1970s, he began working as an independent consultant. <br>
          More Specifically; in 1978 he moved to D.G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset which was run by two of his friends, Dennis Nash and John Poole, where he created type-setting software for printers and wrote a multitasking operating system; before quickly leaving for Geneva in 1980. <br> <br>
          From June to December in 1980, he worked for a European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, as a consultant software engineer. <br>
          CERN operated the largest particle physics laboratory in the world, and it resides on the border of France and Switzerland in Geneva. <br> 
          While he was there, he made a proposal to the company for a project based on “hypertext” which would make automated information-sharing and updating of information by researchers less demanding and more intuative. <br> 
          Berners-Lee then devised a prototype system called ENQUIRE to demonstrate how this system could potentially work. <br> 
          The name of the system came from a Victorian book called “Enquire Within Upon Everything”. <br> <br>
          This would be the fundamental foundation for the development of the 'World Wide Web' several years later. <br> <br>

        <h1 class="headings-page1">Later Employment</h1> <br>
        <p>After he left CERN in late 1980, Berners-Lee became a Director at John Poole's Image Computer Systems LTD in Bournemouth, Dorset. <br> 
          For three years he was in charge of the technical side of the company. <br>
          His work involved real-time control firmware, graphics, communications software, and generic macro languages. <br> 
          This allowed him to gain experience many fields, such as: computer networking, graphics and communications software. <br> <br>
          In 1983, Vinton Cerf created the first commercial internet “email” system where information could be shared between individuals using email addresses. <br> 
          Berners-Lee, with his ENQUIRE proposal, wanted to devise a system that would allow the general public to have intuative internet access soon after<br> <br>
          Berners-Lee returned to CERN in 1984, after recieving a Fellowship, which is a monetary award given to scholars to pay for their academic pursuits, where there is a less than 20% success rate for applicants. <br>
          By 1989, CERN was relayed to be the largest internet node in Europe. <br> <br> <br>
