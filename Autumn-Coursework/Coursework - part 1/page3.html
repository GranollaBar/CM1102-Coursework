        <h1 class="headings-page1">Chronological Impact of The World Wide Web</h1> <br>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee had laid the ground work for documentation on a global scale by the use of the World Wide Web. <br>
          Others companies would soon create multiple browsers for the next 3 decades, each improving features and qualities of the last <br> <br>
          After the creation of the first publically available browser, Mosaic in 1993, Andreessen cofounded Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1994, where it became became the dominant Web browser soon after its release in December 1994. <br> 
          BookLink Technologies' InternetWorks created the first browser with tabs, in which a user could visit another Web site without opening an entirely new window; debuting that same year. <br> 
          By the mid-1990s the World Wide Web had millions of active users, due to the popularity of computer systems booming. <br> <br>
          The software giant Microsoft Corporation became interested in supporting Internet applications on personal computers and developed its own Web browser (based initially on Mosaic), Internet Explorer, in 1995 as an add-on to the Windows 95 operating system. <br> 
          Internet Explorer was then integrated into the Windows operating system in 1996, which had the effect of reducing competition from other Internet browser manufacturers, such as Netscape, due to it being integrated into the operatin system. <br> 
          It then soon became the most popular Web browser on the market. <br> <br> 
          Apple's Safari was released in 2003 as the default browser on Macintosh personal computers and later on iPhones (2007) and iPads (2010). <br>
          Safari 2.0 (2005) was the first browser with a privacy mode, Private Browsing, in which the application would not save Web sites in its history, downloaded files in its cache, or personal information entered on Web pages.
          The first serious challenger to Internet Explorers dominance was Mozilla's Firefox, released in 2004, and designed to address issues with speed and security that had plagued Internet Explorer previously. <br> 
          In 2008 Google launched Chrome, the first browser with isolated tabs, which meant that when one tab crashed, other tabs and the whole browser would still function. <br>
          And by 2013, Chrome had become the dominant browser, surpassing Internet Explorer and Firefox in popularity. <br>
          Microsoft discontinued Internet Explorer and replaced it with Edge in 2015. <br> <br>
          In the early 21st century, smartphones became more computer-like, and more-advanced services, such as Internet access, became possible. Web usage on smartphones steadily increased, and in 2016 it accounted for more than half of Web browsing. <br> <br> <br>
          This shows just how prominent the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 was for general use, as an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet allowed for many adantages explored below. <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <h1 class="headings-page1">How The World Wide Web Benefits Society</h1> <br>
        <p>The creation of the World Wide Web has allowed for technology and research on an unprecedented scale <br>
          It has allowed for global documentation of our planet's history, science, being, etc. <br>
          There are many advantages that make the invention of the World Wide Web, one of, if not, the most important development of the last 50 years <br> <br> <br>
        </p>
        <ol type="1" class="ordered-list">
          <li>
            Firstly, the World Wide Web offers a rapid interactive communication system with all devices that have ever, and will ever be invented. <br>
            Many different types of services become available to a user with the World Wide Web, such as: Communication services, information retrieval services, file transfer services, web services, directory services, etc. <br> <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly, The World Wide Web is an internet-based service that uses a common set of rules known as protocols, to distribute documents across the internet. <br>
            This standardizes the formatting and processing of data on the internet, by using a set of rules to adhere by. <br>
            It allows allows commuincation with other computers within a network, irregardless of the types of hardware or software involved in its creation, which benefits speeding up production between devices. <br> <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, It alows global communication, in terms of messaging and diplomatically tying countries together <br>
            This includes social media forums for general users, such as: Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, allowing people to form connection on an international scale <br>
            Countries, businesses and individuals can email each other and talk on various videotelephony software, such as: Microsoft Teams and Zoom, in order to discuss ideas, life stories and our changing economic world <br> <br> 
          </li>
          <li>
            Moreover, huge volumes of data can be exchanged over many different faciliteis and sectors found in the real world, such as: education, healthcare, defenses, etc. <br>
            This keeps people up to date on current relations and events occuring in the world, which results in changing global markets and stock exchanges. <br>
            Improvments in science and other fields of research will also be enchanced due to the combined knowledge of many labs and universities everywhere, improving life for everyone. <br> <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, the World Wide Web is accessible from anywhere, at anytime <br>
            Even if your machine is broken, tablets, phones, ipads, consoles, other computer systems and more, will allow you to access the World Wide Web <br>
            This means businesses can have workers come into their offices and work simultaenously on different devices, whilst communicating with others and accessing information on the web <br> <br> <br>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <b><u>Here is a full-list of other advantages which also make The World Wide Web advantageous:</u></b> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Address, mapping, and contact information</li> <br>
            <li>Selling and making money</li> <br>

        <p> In 1994, Berners-Lee left CERN to join MIT and founded the International World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), where he was managing director <br>
          This was needed in order to create an international committee decided to improving the web. It is made up of several hundred members as of 2022 <br> <br> <br>
          In 2004, Tim Berners-Lee was Promoted to Knight Commander, by the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours <br> 
          The award was appointed "for his services to the global development of the Internet". <br> <br>
          He was also Appointed a member of the Order of Merit on 13<sub>th</sub> June 2007, which is an order restricted to 24 (living) members. The Order of Merit is within the personal gift of The Queen, and does not require recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister <br> <br> <br>
          In 1994, he became one of only six members of the World Wide Web Hall of Fame. <br> <br> <br>
          He is the founding Director of the Web Science Trust (WST) launched in 2009 to promote research and education in Web Science, the study of humanities connection by technology <br> <br> <br>
          The 2016 Turing Award was accepted by him on 4<sub>th</sub> April 2017, "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale" <br> <br> <br>
          <b>
            These are only the main awards that Time-Berners Lee won throughout 1994-2017, where in total he racked up a count of 43 awards and 5 national honours from Britain <br> <br>
            He is now 67 years old, where he works solely as the director of the World Wide Web Consortium <br> <br> <br>
            <u>However, he will always be considered the founder and creator of the World Wide Web</u>  <br> <br>
