        <h1 class="headings-page1">Conception & Implementation</h1> <br>
        <p>Computers were commercially successful in the 1980s, when they started marketing them towards consumers as affordable and accessible technology of the future <br> 
          However, the use of these computers was limited due to a lack of resources on the internet, leading to them mostly being used by businesses for communicating with one another and other business-related shenanigans <br> <br>
          During his time at CERN, Tim noticed thousands of workers needed to share information and data with each other on a regular basis <br>
          Vinton Cerf's email system (which was invented a couple years before) was beneficial, however many would have to keep to keep track of many different things simultaneously, slowing down productivety at the lab <br>
          Tim knew that the invention of an interconnected system of public webpages would allow for easier transmission of information through documentation <br> <br>
          Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for a more effective communication system, where he would meld hypertext with the internet to produce his idea, known as, "Information Management: A Proposal”, in march 1989. <br> 
          This system was designed fundamentally to share information globally, without the need for emails. <br> <br>
          The system was named 'World Wide Web' and Berners-Lee also designed and built the first web browser. <br> <br>

        <legend class="legend-titles-page2">-The Creation of The World Wide Web-</legend> <br>
        <h1 class="headings-page1">The World Wide Web</h1> <br>
        <p>It has to be stated that Tim Berners-Lee did not invent hypertext. <br>
          The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades, however nearly all hypertext systems only worked on local files on a system <br> 
          Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across multiple networks so that people could link a file from one machine to another file on another machine. <br> <br>
          The first browser ever invented by Tim was the WorldWideWeb. <br> 
          This wasn't just a programme for browsing files, it was also a browser and an editor. The introductory text on the system reads: <br> <br> <br>
          "HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee". <br> <br> <br>
          He created the WorldWideWeb browser on the NeXTstep operating system (developed by NeXT Computer, inc.) in 1990. <br>
          There are many features associated to this browser, such as: browsing, linking to other websites, tools for creation of HTML, multiple ways to customise web-pages, with fieldsets, buttons, image-buttons, panels, menus, URL's styling, etc. <br>
          The flexibility for creating web-pages was astonishing, as Tim and his colleagues thought that no one would want to write HTML by hand, and therefore thought an interface would need to be prepared in order to simplify the creation process for web-pages <br> <br>
          However, Berners-Lee wanted to avoid confusion between the 'World Wide Web' and the WorldWideWeb (i.e. the first browser). <br>
          He renamed the browser to Nexus, closely ressembling the name of the operating system he used to develop the browser. <br>
          The browser allowed users to connect to the internet, and this wasn't too much of an issue as people used dial-up internet. <br>
          These connections were around 20-50 kbps and powered by a 9600 baud modem (i.e. symbols per secons). <br>
          Sadly, if the phone lines were very far away or they were busy, then the connection to the browser became very limited <br> <br>
          In 1991, Berners-Lee released his WWW software. <br>
          It included the 'line-mode' browser, Web server software and libraries for developers. <br>
          In March 1991, the software became available to workers using CERN computers; and a few months later, in August 1991, he announced the WWW software on Internet newsgroups and interest in the project spread around the world. <br> <br>
          Paul Kunz and Louise Addis created the first Web server in the US, which came online in December 1991. <br> 
          once again, it was made in a particle physics laboratory in California, known as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). <br>
          At this stage, there were essentially only two kinds of browser; One was the original development version by Berners-Lee, which was sophisticated but available only on NeXT computer machines and the other was the 'line-mode' browser, which was easy to install and run on any platform, but limited in power and user-friendliness. <br> 
          It was clear that the small team at CERN could not do all the work needed to develop the system further, so Berners-Lee inaugurated an appeal on the internet for other developers to join them. <br> 
          Several individuals wrote browsers, mostly for the X-Window System. Notable among these were MIDAS by Tony Johnson from SLAC, Viola by Pei Wei from technical publisher O'Reilly Books, and Erwise by Finnish students from Helsinki University of Technology. <br>
          The first commercially availiable computer internet browser would be built several years later, being produced by Mosaic in 1993. <br> <br>
          <span style="color:blue;">info.cern.ch</span> was the address of the world's first website and Web server <br> 
          The first Web page address was <span style="color:blue;">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</span> <br> <br>
